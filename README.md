My name is Cora Rueda. I completed my undergrad at the University of Arizona with a degree in Natural Resources. I recently moved to Maine with my husband and two cats! I currently work for the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service as a Resource Conservationist. I work with farmers and foresters to conserve natural resources on their properties and I assist the statewide field operations team in New Hampshire. In my free time, I enjoy reading, hiking, cooking, and surfing.
